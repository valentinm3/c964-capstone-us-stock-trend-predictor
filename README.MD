# ðŸ“Š Stock Price Prediction Dashboard

## Description
The Stock Price Prediction Dashboard is a web application designed to predict and analyze trends in the US stock market. The project utilizes historical stock data from 2020-2024, leveraging machine learning techniques (Random Forest) to forecast future stock prices. The goal of this dashboard is to help users optimize their investment strategies, reduce financial risk, and gain insights into various stocks through interactive visualizations.

The application offers features such as future price prediction, feature importance analysis, and visualization of model metrics, all presented in an easy-to-use web interface powered by Streamlit.

## Features
- **Stock Price Prediction**: Predict future stock prices using a Random Forest model.
- **Historical Price Visualization**: Plot stock prices over time for selected stocks.
- **Feature Importance Analysis**: Understand which features influence the Random Forest model's predictions the most.
- **Model Evaluation Metrics**: Display metrics like RÂ², Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
- **Correlation Heatmap**: Visualize correlations between different stocks for deeper insights.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Web Framework**: Streamlit
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, RandomForestRegressor
- **Data Handling**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: Plotly

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure that you have **Python 3.8+** installed on your system.  

**Important Note:** Many of the steps in these instructions require you to type commands into a terminal window. 
If you use the command terminal on Windows 10, you can highlight the commands from the instructions and copy them with 
Ctrl-C on your keyboard, then right-click on your terminal window to paste the command directly. Doing this ensures you 
donâ€™t have a typo and is much faster.

### Install Python and Pip
If you do not already have Python and pip installed, follow these steps:

1. **Open a Command Terminal**:
   - On **Windows**: Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press `Enter`.
   - On **Mac/Linux**: Open the **Terminal** application.  

2. **Check if Python is Installed**:
   Open a command terminal and run:
   ```sh
   python --version
   ```
   If Python is not installed, proceed to the next step.  

3. **Download Python:**
   - Download and install Python from the [official Python website.](https://www.python.org/downloads/) Make sure to
     check the box for "Add Python to PATH" during installation.

4. **Check if Pip is Installed**:
   Open a command terminal and run:
   ```sh
   pip --version
   ```
   If Pip is not installed, proceed to the next step.
5. **Install Pip (if needed)**
   - Download the `get-pip.py` script by visiting [get-pip.py](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py) or running:
   
   ```sh
   curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
   ```
   - Run the script to install `pip`:
   ```sh
   python get-pip.py
   ```

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/valentinm3/stock-price-prediction-dashboard-capstone.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```sh
    cd stock-price-prediction-dashboard-capstone
    ```
3. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
    ```sh
    python -m venv .venv
    ```
4. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   - On **Windows**:
     ```sh
     .venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On **Mac/Linux**:
     ```sh
     source .venv/bin/activate
     ```
5. **Install dependencies**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
6. **Run the app**:
    ```sh
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

## Usage
Once the application is running, you can access the dashboard through your web browser. The dashboard allows you to:

- Select a stock from the available options to view its historical price trends.
- Predict future stock prices based on the selected stock's historical data.
- View feature importance to understand which factors most influence the predictions.
- Analyze model performance through various evaluation metrics.
- Explore correlations between different stocks using the heatmap visualization.
